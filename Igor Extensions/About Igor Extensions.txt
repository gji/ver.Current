This is one of two special Igor Extensions folders.

The other is created by Igor 6.1 or later when Igor starts up, and is normally
located here:

	<My Documents>\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Extensions

A simple way to locate that folder is to choose "Show Igor Pro 6 User Files" from
Igor's Help Menu.

You can put Igor extension files in here or shortcuts pointing to extension files.

When Igor starts up, if it finds any Igor extension files (or shortcuts to
files) in either of these folders, Igor will open them automatically
when it starts up.

Extensions add to Igor features such as:
  loading specific types of files
  number-crunching operations and functions
  data-acquisition

You will find additional extensions in the More Extensions folder.
To activate an extension in the More Extensions folder, right-click
the extension file and choose "Copy", and then locate the

	<My Documents>\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Extensions

folder by choosing "Show Igor Pro 6 User Files" from Igor's Help Menu.

Open that Igor Extensions folder, right click inside and choose "Paste Shortcut".

Then restart Igor Pro.

PER-USER IGOR EXTENSIONS

  Users without administrative rights might not be able to put files or shortcuts
  inside any folder in the Igor Pro Folder. We recommend you use
  
 	<My Documents>\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Extensions\

  to activate Igor extensions.
  
  Additionally, as with previous versions of Igor, the administrator can set up a
  "per-user shortcut" in the installed Igor Extensions folder using a target path that
  uses the %USERPROFILE% environment variable. Then each user can create such a folder
  in their Documents and Settings folder to match.

  For example, if the administrator creates a shortcut in the installed Igor Pro Folder's
  Igor Extensions subfolder, and the target of that shortcut is:

	"%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Igor Global Extensions"

  (Note: the quotes are required to make the shortcut resolve properly, and the
  administrator will probably need to create the Igor Global Extensions folder in
  the My Documents folder to successfully create the shortcut.)

  then a user named "Fred" would create a folder here:

	C:\Documents and Settings\Fred\My Documents\Igor Global Extensions 

  and put any XOPs (or shortcuts to XOPs) he wanted to load when Igor starts.

 CREATING YOUR OWN IGOR EXTENSIONS
 
	If you are a C programmer, you can create your own extensions
	using the optional "IGOR XOP Toolkit".
